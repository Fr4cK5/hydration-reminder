## Hydration Reminder

A small, unintrusive application to remind you to hydrate!

## Usage

Just let it run! You will be reminded to hydrate every 20 minutes.

No notifications or sounds, just some text changing its color. (Yes, this was made for setups with more than 1 monitors.)

Once reminded, just click the text that says "Hydrate 💧" and it'll shut up for 20 minutes.

## Build

```sh
cargo build --profile opt
```
